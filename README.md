# FizzBuzzHorror

I'm not saying we've all done it, but . . .

Console application. Type the executable name and a number to FizzBuzz to that point. 20,000 cycles is around an hour on my machine. 

Yes I know the repository is spelled wrong. Do you think this warrants spending the time to rename it?

Anyway, the true horror is by passing "-good <number>" it uses a reasonable routine, which takes 5 seconds for 20,000 cycles.
